# A poem to motivate yourself

Are you too tired? 

Didn't get enough sleep? 

Don't have enought energy?

Don't have enough time? 

Is that what's stopping you right now?

Don't have enough money?

Is that the thing?

Or is the thing that's stopping you?

You?

Excuses sound best

to the person who's making them up

Stopping felling sorry for yourself.

Get off the pity potty

Telling everyboday you're sad

and sob stories, trying to get people

to show up to your pity parties

and your pity parades

If you ever see me in a rolls royce

a six or seven star hotel

living my life to the fullest

Don't get jealous of me

becasue I worked my ass off to get it

Noboday handed me nohting

Wake your ass up

Awaken the beast inside

It's game on

It's go season

It's time for your to take advantage of the access

and the resources that you have

in your country and your commmunity

You got a problem with your life?

You got a problem with your environment?

Do something about it.

If you want it

go get it

Recognise

the excuses are not valid

they're conjured up

they're fabricated

they're lies

And how do you stop the lies

You stop the lies with the truth

And the truth is

you have time

you have the skill

you have the knowledge

and the support

and the willpower

and the discipline

to get it done.

The fruit of everything good in life

begins with a challenge.

Everything is uphill that's worthwhile

And it's not going to come to you

And it's not going to fall in your lap

and it's not going to be something that, oh my gosh,

it just was so simple

it's always going to be difficult.

If you want it, you gotta go get it.

This is your chance.

This is your shot.

This is your moment.

This is your time.

This is your place.

This is your oppotunity.

This is my time.

This is my moment.

Tommorrow, tomorrow, tommorrow,

ain't no such thing as tommorrow

We only got today

It's your dream

If you're going to have it

get your butt up and make it happen

If you're going to have it

rise and grind

You still got work to do

stay on that basketball court

stay on that football field

it's grind season homie.
