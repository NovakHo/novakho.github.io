I'm a product manager based in Hangzhou ****with 7 years of experience in the security industry. 
My focus area for the past few years has been CCTV surveillance and access control overseas market, but it turns to privilege access management market in recent two years. I love interacting with people and I am passionate about learning new skills. I think passion, excelling, and talent are the way to grow.

## 🛠 Skills

### 💻 Technology

#### Linux Shell⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it during my whole career. Shell command is quite explicit and efficient which is definitely my favorite.

#### Python ⭐️

I've started learning it recently and found it challenging (in a good way!) I'm not proficient yet but I've worked on some features and fixes on my own.

#### Technical Writing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I enjoy writing about technical subjects and I feel I can do a pretty good job of it! My motivation is explaining things in simple and practical terms and thus making things easier for others.
